      Here you will see different HTML tags on the left side of the table and a short description on the right.

      <table width = "100%"border=1px; cellspacing=0>
      <caption>HTML Tags and Attributes</caption>

      <ul>
        <tr>
          <td><li>Headers - &lth1&gt, &lth2&gt, &lth3&gt,...</li></td>
          <td><li>Paragraphs - &ltp&gt</li></td>
          <td><li>Images - &ltimg&gt</li></td>
          <td><li>Links - &lta href&gt</li></td>
          <td><li>Lists - &ltul&gt, &ltol&gt, &ltdl&gt</li></td>
        </tr>
      </ul>

      <ol type = "1"><!-- Finally found how to use actual lists in tables properly but now this ordered list is showing bullets even after changing the type. I assume it must be something with how I changed the table properties with CSS or that CSS has tricked me in some way with ordered lists. I could have just added the numbers for each cell but I didn't think you would like that. If we didnt have to use actual lists to number it and I just misread the requirements...idk I'll be sad. I've returned to thsi comment upon giving up home when doing the CSS part of the assignment. It seems that the way I got lists to work in a table has squashed my chances of properly making every other row be a light gray background. I know how to do it and all that its just that my struggle earlier has resulted in more struggle now.-->
        <tr>
          <td><li>Similar to the healdlines in a newspaper. Different sizes can be used with 'h1' being the largest then to 'h2' and so on </li></td>
          <td><li>Similar to the subtext below the headlines in a newspaper. </li></td>
          <td><li>Images can be sourced from the internet or from the web server by either using a link or a file path</li></td>
          <td><li>Adding links to a website can make navigating to another part of the site or to another website altogether easier. &lta&gt is used alongside href as the attribute to the hyperlink</li></td>
          <td><li>There are many types of lists. The name of each quickly explains each types usage. Unordered List &ltul&gt, Ordered List &ltol&gt, Description List &ltdl&gt, and Nested Lists which can use any type of list. Each uses &ltli&gt to define elements in the list</li></td>
