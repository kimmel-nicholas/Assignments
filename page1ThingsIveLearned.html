    <h1>A few things I've learned so far...</h1>
    
    <ol type = "I">
      <li> The first thing we learned in class was not about coding. Instead it was a sort of introduction on how the Internet came to be and how it works. 
        <ol type = "i">
          <li>The Internet is a connection between two computers. The client computer uses a web browser to display a website received from a web server which is just another computer somewhere else which hosts to the website.</li>
          <li>The first usage of the Internet was done by Tim Berners- Lee in 1989. He invented the World Wide Web as a CERN software engineer. The World Wide Web was initially used by scientists in order to share their findings, results and data around the world. Overtime the World Wide Web blossomed into what we know today as the Internet.</li>
          </ol>
      </li>
      <li> Next, we learned about the basics of coding for the internet, mainly how to make very basic websites. 
        <ol type = "i">
          <li>The main and most basic thing we learned that I know will follow me throughout all my website programming is headers and paragraphs. Both are used to display text on the screen for the user to see. A header, as one would expect, is the similar to headline in a newspaper while a paragraph is a sort of subtext that would usually be seen describing the headline in more length.</li>
          <li>We also learned how to use images in our website which I didn’t think we would learn about until later in the semester. I now know that one can use images directly off the internet by just copying the link while I always though the images would have to come from the website’s own server.</li>
          <li>I also learned some of the basics of CSS which has made our webpages more aesthetically pleasing as well as how to make a title. Titles are the short description of the website that appear on the tabs at the top of a web browser. I found this interesting because they’re things I never really thought about as being controlled by the code of a website.</li>
          </ol>
      </li>
      <li>One of the more complex and recent things we learned about are lists.
        <ol type = "i">
          <li>Just like other programming languages, HTML has many different types of lists. These list are used in different ways since they are to be seen by the user. These types of lists include Unordered Lists, Ordered Lists, Descriptions Lists, and Nesting Lists.</li>
          <li>Lists in HTML are different from lists in other high-level languages. Even what you’re reading here is in one of HTML’s more visually appealing lists called a Nesting lists. This Nesting List allows me to have these subpoints withing the list of main points.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>Finally, this is the only class I’ve had that has required me to use more than one language. 
        <ol type = "i">
          <li>These two languages are HTML and CSS. HTML is what’s known as a markup language and CSS is a style sheet language. So far, we have mainly been used HTML, yet we are just starting to get into CSS.</li>
          <li>As its description implies, CSS largely involving the style of the website. Things like fonts, colors, and backgrounds can be changed using it. Personally, I don’t care much about making my work pretty as long as it does work but I know it is very important since my work could be something that hundreds of users see. </li>
          <li>It is interesting to me how HTML and CSS work together and I’m curious if other languages do this as well (Specifically languages more similar to Python, Java, and C). Later in the semester we are supposed to learn about JavaScript so it will be interesting to see how all three of these work together and what all can be done by each alone.
